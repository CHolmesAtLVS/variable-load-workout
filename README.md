## üóÑÔ∏è MCP Server: anyquery (SQLite-backed)

This project can use the [anyquery](https://github.com/julien-c/anyquery) MCP server to provide a lightweight SQL API over your TRM data (or any SQLite database). This enables advanced querying and integration with other tools.

### Installation

Run the following commands to install anyquery on Ubuntu:

```bash
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.julienc.me/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/anyquery.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install anyquery
```

### Usage

- By default, anyquery can serve any SQLite database file (such as your TRM data) over HTTP with a simple REST API.
- See the [anyquery documentation](https://github.com/julien-c/anyquery) for details on configuration and usage.
